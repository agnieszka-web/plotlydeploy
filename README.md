# Belly Button Biodiversity

Bacterial species have ability to synthesize protein that taste like beef. “Improbable Beef” sampled navels of volunteers to see what bacteria is growing in their navels.  In this challenge I created a website where the volunteers can select their id number and see what bacteria is growing in their navels.  The Top Ten  Bacterial Cultures found bar graphs shows the top bacterial cultures in their navel, the Gauge shows how many times a week the belly button was washed, and the bubble chart shows all the bacterial cultures per sample.
